IO::Pager version 0.10
=====================

IO::Pager - Select a pager and pipe text to it if destination is a TTY


IO::Pager is lightweight and can be used to locate an available pager
and set the PAGER environment variable sanely or as a factory for creating
objects defined elsewhere such as IO::Pager::Buffered and IO::Pager::Unbuffered.

IO::Pager subclasses are designed to programmatically decide whether
or not to pipe a filehandle's output to a program specified in PAGER.
Subclasses are only required to support filehandle output methods print(),
printf(), write() and close().

PORTABLE

IO::Pager is intended to be as portable as possible, I've tested it on numerous
platform and perl version combinations. Most work fine though you may run
into quirks, it tends to be happiest under perl built with perlio not stdio.
