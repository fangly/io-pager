IO::Pager version 0.16
=====================

IO::Pager - Select a pager and pipe text to it if destination is a TTY


IO::Pager is lightweight and can be used to locate an available pager
and set the PAGER environment variable sanely or as a factory for creating
objects defined elsewhere such as IO::Pager::Buffered and IO::Pager::Unbuffered.

IO::Pager subclasses are designed to programmatically decide whether
or not to pipe a filehandle's output to a program specified in PAGER.
Subclasses may inherit from IO::Pager, and imlpement the IO handle
methods desired.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

   make test
   # Run interactive tests

DEPENDENCIES

Multiple core modules are used: base, Env, File::Spec, Symbol, Tie::Handle

File::Which (part of the modern core) is strongly recommended

Test::More is used during the installation procedure.

PORTABILITY

IO::Pager is intended to be as portable as possible, I've tested it on numerous
platform and perl version combinations. Most work fine though you may run
into quirks, it tends to be happiest under perl built with perlio not stdio.
