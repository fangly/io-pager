0.10	Unreleased

	Added support for encodings via binmode() (bug# 67930).

	Test: encoding, handle (glob, scalar, OO), interactive...

0.07	Unreleased

	Rewrote to support scalar filehandles per user request and IO::Handle
	style OO support came along for the ride.

	Fixed several mis-coded segments that did not affect operation.

	Added C<tell> in IO::Pager::Unbuffered to check size of buffered output.

	Pager open error now sets $! instead of issuing a warning, to more
	closely emulate the C<open> experience. Check return value as before.
