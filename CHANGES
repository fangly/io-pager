	Fork Term::Pager to IO::Pager::Perl, with many new features.
	NOTE: This is a breaking change from 0.43 & 0.44. What was
	IO::Pager::Perl in those versions is now IO::Pager::less i.e;
	a shim for pager-less systems to use the pure perl pager
	implementation in IO::Pager::Perl.

	Update bloody version number transclusions. RT#130643

0.44	Mon Sep 30 2019
	Remove debugging calls mistakenly left in code. RT#130595

	Skip testing on dumb "terminal" setups. RT#130596

	Add (unexposed) code for less -J search line highlighting,
	and more form feed break to tp (IO::Pager::Perl).

0.43	Sun Sep 29 2019
	Roll out a suboptimal but functional IO::Pager::Perl,
	fixing RT#130461 and RT#130565

	Disambiguate tee open. RT#127551

	Stringify version. RT#127342

	Add bignum dependency RT#130319

	Add support for eventual Term::Pager v1.5

	Update META files.

0.40	Mon Oct 08 2018
	And a tee(1)-like feature via binmode().

	Fix some interactive tests; 07 and 10.

	Document potentially surprising behaviors in IO::Pager::Buffered.

        One more bloody RT#121450; missed 11-redirect-oo.pl

0.39	Sat May 13 2017
	Rename t.pl to test.pl and alter behavior to address RT#120618
	i.e; MakeMaker's "helpfulness"; alternative is explicitly list
	all PM in module.

	More bloody RT#121450

0.38	Tue May 11 2017
0.37	Tue Apr 25 2017

	Add some additional reporting to interactive tests.

	Fixed several mis-coded segments that did not affect operation.

	Added C<tell> in IO::Pager::Unbuffered to check size of buffered output.

	Pager open error now sets $! instead of issuing a warning, to more

	Removed a stupid debug message from IO::Pager::new.

	Improved PAGER selection algorithm.
