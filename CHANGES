Revision history for Perl extension IO::Pager.

0.xx 

      Look for more pagers: 'most' and 'w3m' (bug# 74519)

      Doc clarifications, light refactoring, more error checks.

      Do not run pager automatically when in Perl compile mode.

      Removed Perl warning 'Use of tie on a handle without * is deprecated'.

      Better handling of missing or wrongly set PAGER, and checking usual pagers
      after that.

      No interactive questions during tests (bug# 66718).

0.10 Unreleased

      Added support for encodings via binmode() (bug# 67930).

      Test: encoding, handle (glob, scalar, OO), interactive...

0.07 Unreleased

      Rewrote to support scalar filehandles per user request and IO::Handle
      style OO support came along for the ride.

      Fixed several mis-coded segments that did not affect operation.

      Added C<tell> in IO::Pager::Unbuffered to check size of buffered output.

      Pager open error now sets $! instead of issuing a warning, to more
      closely emulate the C<open> experience. Check the return value as before.

      Neglected to update $VERSION in last release.

      Touched up the documentation.

0.06 Wed Sep 21 2005

      Fixed a stupid leftover using =~ for assignment that some perls ignored
      (bug# 14692).

      Fixed other nits in t.pl and documentation.

0.05 Thu Jul 17 20:01:55 EDT 2003

      Touched up documentation.

      Added IO::Pager::Page, a clone of IO::Page "Broken pipe" foible and all.

      Fixed a bug in pager selection algorithm, it failed if you did not
      have File::Which. It is now back to being only strongly recommended as
      opposed to required.

0.04 Wed Jul 16 18:53:58 EDT 2003

      Removed a stupid debug message from IO::Pager::new.

      Improved PAGER selection algorithm.

      Touched up documentation.

      Added some tests.

0.03 Tue Jul 15 23:11:12 2003

      Forked from IO::Page.

0.02 Tue Jul 15 23:11:12 2003

      original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options -X -n IO::Pager.
