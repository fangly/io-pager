0.07	Unreleased

	Rewrote to support scalar filehandles per user request and IO::Handle
	style OO support came along for the ride.

	Fixed several mis-coded segments that did not affect operation.

	Added C<tell> in IO::Pager::Unbuffered to check size of buffered output.

	Pager open error now sets $! instead of issuing a warning, to more
