0.16
	Clean-up/clarify returned object vs. filehandle?
		...(partially) done since OO is documented (.20)

0.10
	XXX Implement eof?
		To indicate SIGPIPE? ...handler localization difficulties (.16)

	Hijack something to return filehandle(?),
	but this amounts to nothing more than showing our private parts?

		Accessor for pager too? (.21)
