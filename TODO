Important things here and in code flagged with XXX

0.21
	Test PID? ( defined? >0? `ps`?)

0.20
	"Fix" multi-pseudo-STDOUT disabled in 9-open.t implementation?

	Alter tests to cover all invocation schemes,
	and document location of each in matrix?
		new/open each class
		scalar vs. glob vs. OO
		(non-)fully qualified subclass name

	Complicate IO::Pager::new code to make it smartly use first
	arg as FH or subclass and remove need for ungainly undef?

	"3-arg open" with layer?

0.16
	XXX Test documented implicit closing when object passes out of scope;
	previously via alias of DESTROY to CLOSE, but unnice if explicit close.
		Broken UNTIE? (0.21)

	Clean-up/clarify returned object vs. filehandle?
		...(partially) done since OO is documented (.20)

0.10
	Implement eof?
		To indicate SIGPIPE? ...handler localization difficulties (.16)

	Hijack something to return filehandle(?),
	but this amounts to nothing more than showing our private parts?
		Alas tied FH have no STAT method to pass child as inode (.16)
		Accessor for pager too? (.21)

0.02
	Implement IO::Pager::Callback, just because it sounds cool?
