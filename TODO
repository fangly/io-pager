	!!! Document use of scalar filehandles

	Alter tests to cover all 6 invocation schemes? (new/open each class)
	      ... and scalar vs. glob for each

0.16
	Test documented implicit closing when object passes out of scope;
	previously via alias of DESTROY to CLOSE, but unnice if explicit close.

	Implement OO via IO::Wrap/IO::WrapTie/IO::File, or othersuch
	    ...Filter::Handle<http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=27415>:
		  # An OO interface for free! :-)
		  *new = *TIEHANDLE;
		  *print = *PRINT;

	Clean-up/clarify returned object vs. filehandle?

0.10
	Implement eof?
		To indicate SIGPIPE? ...handler localization difficulties (.16)

	Hijack something to return filehandle(?), child pid(!),
	but this amounts to nothing more than showing our private parts?
	Alas tied handles have no STAT method to pass child as inode

	Implement IO::Pager::Callback, just because it sounds cool?
